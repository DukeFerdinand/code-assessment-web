### Build Log 1.5.5

Setting everything to mobile mode was a much easier task than I initially expected. I didn't expect it to be toooo hard, but it ended up being really easy thanks to my copious use of flexboxes.

The only bad thing is the modal scroll disabling. I got it to work in a Desktop browser and device simulator, but the scroll-disabling didn't work on an actual iPhone... I'll try and revisit this, but it's not super high on my priority list as I'm running out of my week to finish this MVP.

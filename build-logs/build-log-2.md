### Build log 2


#### A Tangent
I'm pretty near the end of the assignment now, and it's taught me a lot of what I am and, am not, capable of doing as a developer. I've really enjoyed the task overall, and I'm almost sad that it's close to being done.

It's always really fun starting a new project and figuring things out as you go, and this project was no exception.

I learned a more "redux thunk" approach to developing a React application (I'm more familiar with `redux-saga` in my past experiences), so that was really fun, and definitely an architecture I'm going to try in my own projects.

#### Back on track

Anyways, I finished the `ADD_TO_CART` and `REMOVE_FROM_CART` implementations on the Cart side of things, and I should be good to hook in the live API.

I haven't finished making the `quantity-input` state-reactive quite yet, but that may not end up happening as I'd like to get this done before tomorrow morning (i.e. before my week is up). Also, there are some small UI bugs present when the application is viewed on an iPhone (couldn't find my Samsung phone for an Android comparison).

These small things are regrettable, but not too bad for an MVP done over a week or so.

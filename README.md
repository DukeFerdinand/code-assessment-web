## Tasks

Please publish your work to a fork of this repo. You're welcome (but not required) to add any libraries you think would be helpful.

Note: You're encouraged to show your work by including multiple commits - we'll be looking through your fork's git history.

1. [Implement Responsive Design](/tasks/01-responsive-design.md)
2. [Enhance Cart Functionality](/tasks/02-cart-enhancements.md)
3. [Hook Up Product API](/tasks/03-product-api.md)

Please also update this README file: we'd love to see notes on your decision-making process, links to the most exciting pieces of code, or anything else that will give us additional context when reviewing your assessment.
